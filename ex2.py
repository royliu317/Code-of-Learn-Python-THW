# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by pytohnself.
print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
#print("This won't run.")

print     ("This will run.") #空格在很多情况下是被忽略的
